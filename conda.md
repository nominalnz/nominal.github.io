## Getting started

Use Miniconda to install conda. Using Anaconda for commercial purposes now requires a paid licence and we only need conda. 

Launch Anaconda Prompt from the Start Menu [Windows]. 

Keep conda up to date. Run `conda update conda` before using it. 

List conda environments with `conda info --envs`.

Activate an environment with `conda activate [env_name_or_prefix]`.

Activate the base environment with `conda activate`.
